This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First set up your db credentials by copying `.env.template` and renaming it `.env` and filling out the dummy data.

If you do not have docker installed, now is the time to do so. You can start [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

Next run `npm run start-db` to create & start the db service for the first time. If you have already started it before this should not be necessary.

Now run `npm run dev` to start the Next App and start the services if they are stopped.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
