This is going to be a self-hosted personal collection and library manager, but right now the repo's a mess after I decided to overhaul the project and make it into a Next.js + FastAPI app instead of just a Full Stack Next.js app. I'm working on cleaning it up, and generally doing so in this order:
1. Building the Utils to facilitate CRUD
2. Implementing the utils into the API and cleaning up Routes
3. Refactoring the frontend to use the new endpoints
4. Continuing forward to minimum viable product

If you're here, I appreciate you checking it out! I'll update this readme once it's a bit cleaner and able to be used by someone not actively developing it!
